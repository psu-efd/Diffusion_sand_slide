In this directory, different equilibrium reference concentration formulas are implemented as boundary condtions. These BCs should be used for sediment patches in the Cb_star field only (except the van Rijn (1984) pickup function approach). 

Planned formulas:
1. Zyserman and Fredsoe (1994)
2. Einstein (1950)
3. Engelund and Fredsoe (1976; 1982)
4. Smith and McLean (1977)
5. Van Rijn (1984) (pick up function)


There are other formulas, such as Garcia and Parker (1991) which uses a reference height b=0.05H. However, it is not so clear how to implement them in a 3D code where the boundary layer is resolved or modeled.
