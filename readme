 This repository has the code and cases for the sand slide model. It is developed with
 OpenFOAM v1812.

 1. solvers: geomSlideFoam for geometric sand slide model 
             sandSlideFoam for slope-limited diffusive sand slide model
             scourPimpleDyMFoam for scour model using slope-limited diffusive
             sand slide method.
 2. libraries: library for sediment transport.
 3. utilities: some tools, for example the setup of initial bed elevation 
               field using the setBedShape tool.
 4. cases: all simulation cases.
